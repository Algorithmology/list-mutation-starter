"I adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code while completing this project."

**IMPORTANT:** If you do not type the required sentence then the course
instructor will not know that you adhered to the Allegheny College Honor Code
while completing the project.

## Program Output

### Report at least two examples of program output from when you ran the `systemsense` program

#### First output from running the `systemsense` program

- `command`

```text
output
```

## Data Tables

TODO: You must add instrumentation using tools like `timeit` to ensure that the
`listmutator` calculates and reports the time overhead data that you will need
to complete the entire experiment. Before you conduct your experiments, please
carefully confirm that `listmutator` calculates and reports the time overhead
values in a correct fashion. This means you need to make sure that it reports
the values in an aligned/formatted fashion and that there are labels for
details concerning, for instance, the run number and the unit of measurement.

TODO: Use Markdown to provide one or more data tables that summarize the results
from running the `listmutator` program in all possible different configurations.

## Performance Analysis

TODO: Use several paragraphs and/or a list to explain each of the unique
configurations for which it is possible to run the `listmutator` program. Please
note that, for this algorithm engineering project, you are required to run the
`listmutator` tool in all possible valid configurations so that you can
carefully study the performance of all the key methods provided by the
`SinglyLinkedList` and `DoublyLinkedList` classes. You need to make sure that
you specific values for `--startsize` and `--runs` that ensure the `listmutator`
will report performance results that help you to accurately characterize the
worst-case time complexity of the following linked-based operations:

- `removefirst` that removes data from the `_head` of a `SLL` or `DLL`
- `removelast` that removes data from the `_tail` of a `SLL` and `DLL`
- `__add__` that performs the concatenation of two `SLL` or `DLL` instances
through the use of the `+` operator
- `__iadd__` that performs the concatenation of two `SLL` or `DLL` instances
through the use of the `+=` operator

Your implementation of the `SinglyLinkedList` and `DoublyLinkedList` classes
must adhere to the specification and design provided on the course website. In
addition to providing empirical results in this file you must state what you
think is the worst-case time complexity of each of the operations in the above
list. You must also state whether or not your empirical results confirm and/or
contradict these stated worst-case time complexities. Please note that if the
course website does not provide an implementation of a specific method then you
must create your own implementation that carefully follows the principles to
which the other operations adhere. Finally, while your experiments are only
required to use an input doubling approach to, for instance, study the use of
`int` data inside of the `SLL` and `DLL` instances, you may also consider how
different data types may influence the performance of these required
operations.

TODO: In addition to stating your research questions, this section should have a
summary of your experimental results and an analysis of what those results tell
you about the performance of the operations provided by the `SinglyLinkedList`
and the `DoublyLinkedList` classes.

TODO: Make sure that your responses explain WHY certain configurations are faster!

TODO: It is not sufficient to ONLY explain WHICH configuration is faster!

TODO: It is not sufficient to ONLY discuss the empirical results! You must also
state and explain the worst-case time complexities for each of the stated
methods!

## Professional Development

### Overall, what are the trade-offs associated with building/using a SLL/DLL?

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response that answers this question in your own words.

### What is challenging about designing/running an experiment to evaluate the performance of SLL/DLL?

TODO: Provide a one-paragraph response that answers this question in your own words.

### Take Home Points

TODO: Provide a two to three sentence statement about the key takeaways from
conducting this experiment. Please note that the course instructor will display
some student takeaways on the course website and use them to facilitate
follow-on class discussions.
