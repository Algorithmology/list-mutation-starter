## üèÅ Introduction

If you are a student completing this project as part of a class at Allegheny
College, you can check the schedule on the course web site for the due date or
ask the course instructor for more information about the due date or check the
due date by clicking the appropriate box inside of this file. Please note that
the content provided in the `README.md` file for this GitHub repository is an
overview of the project and thus may not include the details for every step
needed to successfully complete every project deliverable. This means that you
may need to schedule a meeting during the course instructor's office hours to
discuss aspects of this project. Finally, it is important to point out that
your repository for this project was created from the GitHub repository
template called
[list-mutation-starter](https://github.com/Algorithmology/list-mutation-starter);
you can check this repository for any updates to this project's documentation
or source code!

## ü§ù Seeking Assistance

Even though the course instructor will have covered all of the concepts central
to this project before you start to work on it, please note that not every
detail needed to successfully complete the assignment will have been covered
during prior classroom sessions. This is by design as an important skill that
you must practice as an algorithm engineer is to search for and then understand
and ultimately apply the technical content found in additional resources.

## üõ´ Project Overview

This project invites you to implement and use a program called `listmutator`
that conducts an experiment to evaluate the performance of the main operations
provided by the `SinglyLinkedList` (`SLL`) and `DoublyLinkedList` (`DLL`)
classes. The specific operations that your `listmutator` program should evaluate
include these ones:

- `removefirst` that removes data from the `_head` of a `SLL` or `DLL`
- `removelast` that removes data from the `_tail` of a `DLL`
- `__add__` that performs the concatenation of two `SLL` or `DLL` instances
through the use of the `+` operator
- `__iadd__` that performs the concatenation of two `SLL` or `DLL` instances
through the use of the `+=` operator

Both the `SinglyLinkedList` and the `DoublyLinkedList` must be implemented in
an object-oriented fashion as outlined on the course web site. The
`listmutator` program should offer functions that support the automated
generation of either `SinglyLinkedList` and `DoublyLinkedList` instances that
have random integer values while also ensuring that the size of the instances
increases in a predictable manner as would occur when performed through a
doubling experiment. The `listmutator` program should also produce formatted
and justified output that makes it easy for an algorithm engineer to see how,
for a specified operation, the execution time increases as the size of the
`SLL` or `DLL` instances increases. Ultimately, the `listmutator` program
should produce a report that contains empirical results that would make it
possible for an algorithm engineer to confirm the worst-case time complexities
for all basic operations in both the `SLL` and the `DLL`.

The `listmutator` program should also included "timing instrumentation" that
records the cost associated with the aforementioned operations provided by
either a `SLL` or a `DLL`. For instance, the `listmutator` could use the
[timeit](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html) package to measure the
performance of different `SinglyLinkedList` and `DoublyLinkedList` operations,
following the pattern in the article [measure execution time with timeit in
Python](https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-timeit-measure/). After cloning this
repository to your computer, please take the following steps to get started on
the project:

- To install the necessary software for running the `listmutator` program that
you will create as a part of this project, you should install the
[`devenv`](https://devenv.sh/getting-started/) tool, bearing in mind that it is
not necessary for you to install the `cachix` program referenced by these
installation instructions. Please note that students who are using Windows 11
should first install Windows subsystem for Linux (`wsl2`) before attempting to
install `devenv`. Once you have installed `devenv` and cloned this repository to
your computer, you can `cd` into the directory that contains the
`pyproject.toml` file and then type `devenv shell`. It is important to note that
the first time you run this command it may complete numerous steps and take a
considerable amount of time.
- Once this command completes correctly, you will have a Python development
environment that contains Python `3.11.6` and Poetry `1.7.1`! You can verify
that you have the correct version of these two programs by typing:
  - `python --version` (note that you should see `3.11.6`)
  - `poetry --version` (note that you should see `1.7.1`)
- If some aspect of the installation with `devenv` did not work correctly, then
please resolve what is wrong before proceeding further! Alternatively, you may
install the aforementioned versions of Python and Poetry on your laptop. With
that said, please make sure that you only use the specified versions of Python
and Poetry to complete this project. This means that, to ensure that the results
from running the micro-benchmarks are consistent and, as best as is possible,
comparable to the results from other computers, you should use exactly the
specified version of either Python or Poetry.
- Before moving to the next step, you may need to again type `poetry install` in
order to avoid the appearance of warnings when you next run the `listmutator`
program. Now you can type the command `poetry run listmutator --help` and
explore how to use the program.

## üéâ Program Specification

Before implementing the program so that it adheres to the following
requirements and produces the expected output, please note that the program
will not work unless you add the required source code at the designated `TODO`
markers. With that said, after you complete a correct implementation of all the
`listmutator`'s features you can run it with the command `poetry run
listmutator --operation add --startsize 10000 --runs 10 --listtype
singlylinked` and see that it produces output like the following. Please note
that while the following example illustrates the type of output that the
`listmutator` might produce it (a) may offer empirical results that are
different than those that you see on your own laptop and (b) is only for a
single example configuration for how you can run the `listmutator` program.

Minimum execution time: 0.0000034770 seconds for run 1 with size 200
Maximum execution time: 0.0000389430 seconds for run 5 with size 3200

Average execution time: 0.0000159500 seconds across runs 1 through 5
```

Some key aspects of the output that your implementation of the `listmutator`
should preserve are as follows:

- The output should include diagnostic information that explains the type of
list and all of the other command-line arguments that the user specified.
- The output should have labels for each specific run that also shows the total
number of runs requested by the user.
- Each line that shows a performance result should include the size of the list
and then the amount of time in seconds that it took to perform the operation.
- The output should be formatted and justified so that it is easy to read, with
numbers aligned to the right and with a consistent number of decimal places.
- After the display of the execution times that arise from each run of the
benchmark, the output should show the minimum, maximum, and average execution
time values across the runs of the benchmark.

Please note that your implementation of the `listmutator` program should work for
all of the specified experimental configurations in the introduction to the
project and in the `writing/reflection.md` file. If you study the files in the
`listmutator/` directory you will see that they have many `TODO` markers that
designate the functions you must implement so as to ensure that `listmutator`
runs the desired experiment and produces the correct output. Once you complete a
task associated with a `TODO` marker, make sure that you delete it and revise
the prompt associated with the marker into a meaningful comment.

It is important to note that your experimentation with the `listmutator` must
always operate according to the principles of a doubling experiment. This means
that the `listmutator` must systematically increase the size of the instance of
a `SLL` or a `DLL` by doubling the number of values contained inside of the
linked-based list. Ultimately, you should design your own experiment and state
and run experiments to answer your own research questions, focusing on these
key issues:

- If you have already installed the
[GatorGrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade) program that runs the
automated grading checks provided by
[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) you can, from the
repository's base directory, run the automated grading checks by typing
`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml`.
- You may also review the output from running GatorGrader in GitHub Actions.
- Don't forget to provide all of the required responses to the technical writing
prompts in the `writing/reflection.md` file.
- Please make sure that you completely delete the `TODO` markers and their
labels from all of the provided source code. This means that instead of only
deleting the `TODO` marker from the code you should delete the `TODO` marker and
the entire prompt and then add your own comments to demonstrate that you
understand all of the source code in this project.
- Please make sure that you also completely delete the `TODO` markers and their
labels from every line of the `writing/reflection.md` file. This means that you
should not simply delete the `TODO` marker but instead delete the entire prompt
so that your reflection is a document that contains polished technical writing
that is suitable for publication on your professional web site.
