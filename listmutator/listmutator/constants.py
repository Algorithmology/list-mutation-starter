"""Define constants with dataclasses."""

# TODO: define any numerical constants used in the listmutator module

# TODO: make sure that you use the dataclass decorator to create the constants;
# you can refer to your prior algorithm engineering projects for more details

# TODO: a good rule of thumb for defining constants is that if a static analysis
# tool like Ruff suggests that you should not use a "magic number" then that
# should ultimately be a constant defined in this file. With that said, there
# may be other constants that you want to define inside of this module.
