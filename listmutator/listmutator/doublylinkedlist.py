"""A doubly linked list implementation."""

# TODO: Provide a complete implementation for:
# - ListNode
# - DoublyLinkedList

# TODO: Make sure that your implementation adheres to the
# standards described in the project guidelines and on the
# course website.

# TODO: Make sure that you use a ListNode for a DoublyLinkedList

# TODO: You may reuse source code from the course textbook's GitHub repository
# or from the source web site provided that you cite your sources

# TODO: Implement the following methods for a DoublyLinkedList:
# __init__ - Initialize a contained ListNode.
# __init__ - Initialize the doubly linked list.
# __len__ - Return the length of the list.
# addfirst - Add a node with the provided item to the front of the list.
# addlast - Add a node with the provided item to the end of the list.
# removefirst - Remove the first node from the list and return its item.
# removelast - Remove the last node from the list and return its item.
# __add__ - Concatenate the other list to the end of this list and return the new list (i.e., +)
# __iadd__ - Concatenate the other list to the end of this list and update the current list (i.e., +=).

# TODO: Make sure that your implementation of all the classes and methods
# in this file contain type annotations and, when appropriate, at least
# two assertions that confirm an invariant about the state of an object

# TODO: All of the assertions that you add to the methods in these classes
# should pass during their normal operation with an instance of the class
